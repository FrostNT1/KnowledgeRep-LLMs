## Data Collection Strategy

### APIs and Open Datasets

- Utilize APIs like NewsAPI.org and datasets from open data portals.
- Ensure compliance with each API's usage policies and terms.

### Web Scraping

- Scrape content only from websites that permit it, such as PLOS, WHO, and UN.
- Adhere to each site's robots.txt file and terms of service.
- Implement polite scraping practices, including rate limiting and respectful user-agent identification.

### Data Verification

- Cross-reference information across multiple sources.
- Prioritize data that is reported consistently by reputable organizations.

## Ensuring Data Neutrality and Objectivity

To ensure the collected data is factual and free from bias:

### Subjectivity Analysis

- Use natural language processing techniques to assess the subjectivity of the text.
- Retain texts classified as objective, filtering out subjective content.

### Sentiment Analysis

- Apply sentiment analysis models to detect emotionally charged language.
- Exclude content with strong positive or negative sentiments.

### Content Filtering

- Remove texts containing politically biased or opinionated statements.
- Focus on neutral reporting and factual descriptions.

## Data Formatting and Storage

### Data Fields

- **source:** Origin of the content (e.g., website or dataset name).
- **date:** Publication date of the text.
- **text:** The factual content or statement.
- **url:** URL of the original content (if applicable).
- **subjectivity_score:** Numerical score indicating the level of subjectivity.
- **sentiment_score:** Numerical score indicating the sentiment polarity.

### Data Format

- Store data in CSV or JSON files for ease of processing.
- Ensure consistent encoding (e.g., UTF-8) to handle special characters.

### Data Collection

1. Sign up for a NewsAPI key at https://newsapi.org/
2. Create a `.env` file in the project root
3. Add your NewsAPI key to the `.env` file:
   ```
   NEWS_API=your_api_key_here
   ```
4. Run the data collection script:
   ```bash
   python scripts/data/collect_data.py
   ```
